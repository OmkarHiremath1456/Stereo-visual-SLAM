We used the UTIAS stereo dataset, which provides stereo image sequences recorded from a mobile robot in indoor and outdoor environments. It includes synchronized left and right images along with accurate camera calibration parameters like intrinsics and stereo baseline. This allowed us to perform accurate stereo triangulation and trajectory estimation in our SLAM pipeline
